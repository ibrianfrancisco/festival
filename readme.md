# Festival v.0.8

### Description
> Figuring out who to watch at music festivals have become much more difficult. With some events including 100+ artists packed into six stages in only a three day weekend.. there will definitely be some conflicts in watching some of your favorites.
> 
> This is where Festival comes in. It will allow a user to plan out their day at a music festival. With so many artists to choose from, it can become hard to visualize what you're going to do each day and who to watch. Festival will allow users to input who to watch and what to do at each stage.
